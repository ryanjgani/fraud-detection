# Fraud Detection

**SDSC 2001 Python for Data Science**   
Final Course Project  
Taught by Prof. LI Xinyue, City University of Hong Kong  
Final Course Grade: A+  

The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions from a given dataset
that was taken from Kaggle and manipulated by the Professor.

### Project Information
**Language:** Python  
**Technology:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn  

#### Short Summary

There are **5 main modules:**  
- **Data Exploration**  
    We start by exploring the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Data Visualization**  
    Continue to explore the dataset using visualizations and use them to explain the findings.
- **Dimension Reduction**  
    Apply unsupervised learning methods to achieve dimension reduction. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as our dimensionality reduction algorithm.
- **Classification**  
    we use the dataset to train different models which are Gaussian NB, Decision Tree Clasifier, and Logistic Regression. We prepared both data for training and testing. For each model, we count the accuracy scores, plot a confusion matrix, and 5-Fold Cross Validation.
