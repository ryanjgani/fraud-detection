    "## Course Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** <br>\n",
    "a. In the course project, you will analyze a real-world dataset on credit card fraud detection. You will write a report on your data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. <br>\n",
    "b. For each step, make sure to explain what you are doing, annotate your results, and provide your interpretation. <br>\n",
    "c. When you finish, make sure to use `Kernel` -> `Restart and Run All` to restart the kernel and rerun the entire notebook to generate the desired outputs, before submitting your project report. <br>\n",
    "d. Upload your .ipynb file to Canvas for grading. <br>\n",
    "e. All questions related to the course project shall be posted in the Discussions section on Canvas. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy:** <br>\n",
    "The course project is worth 25 points, counting towards 25% of the course final score. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Late submission, empty submission or no submission receives 0 point. Please note that in order to pass the course, at least 30% of the total score for the project must be obtained. In case of special circumstances, email the instructor directly ahead of time. "

    "You can download the csv files from the project folder on Canvas.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "Credit card companies aim to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content\n",
    "The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.\n",
    "Transactions occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, as the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains numerical input variables V1-V28 which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, as original features are not provided due to confidentiality issues. Features that have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 'Amount' denotes the transaction Amount. 'Class' is the response variable (labelled outcome) and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.  <br>"
